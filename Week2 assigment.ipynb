    "Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Python, there are some ways to comment your code for user readability, and these lines are ignored by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "    So, there are ways to comment a code or line in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Generally, two ways are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. For single-line comments: We use the \"#\" symbol to do a single-line comment in Python. \n",
    "                             At the beginning of the line, you put \"#\" symbol to comment a whole line.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: # This line was commented by a single-line comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. For multiline comments: We use triple quotes (''' ''' or \"\"\" \"\"\") to perform multiline comments. \n",
    "                      These methods are used to comment the whole paragraph with an easy manner.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        '''\n",
    "        Hello all, these lines\n",
    "        are commented by multiline\n",
    "        comment method. Thank you.\n",
